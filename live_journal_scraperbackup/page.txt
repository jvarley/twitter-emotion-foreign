Also the obvious theme of Ken as Jesus come as he cures the child of blindness with a touch to the pressure points...(not sure how that solves cateracs) Anyhow, the important part of this arc is it introduces "The Jackel" who is probably favorite villian of the clips I've seen so far.  His fighting phosophy insures that he will last a bit longer then the normal two or three eps arc major villian.  These two eps are also interesting in that Bart (the young boy) is not as annoying as he has been in other eps, both of the childern actually stay put and let Ken handle the issue without being an obstacle... </div><div style="text-align:right">

So the last few days I've started watching the classic anime series "Fist of the North Star".  So far I've watched 10 eps of the show and Kenshiro has blown the heads up of over 50 thugs including bird-ninja men, Army of God/Green beret's/masters of the guerrilla warfare, sultan illusionists.  The head explosions are done tastefully and while the animation quality is crude at best it's still extremely watchable.  I'm amused by his fighting style always having some secret technique that gets him out of any situation he may find himself in. He's followed around by two kids, a greedy boy and a selfless girl, who provide the human element to a story that quickly could devolve into well, a near emotionless romp through a post-apocoplyic playground blowing heads up...(wait that sounds pretty close to what it is anyway).  You can't help but feel sorry for the young girl but the boy character is kind of annoying. Anyhow, bed time. </div><div style="text-align:right">

Why is this a big deal?</b></i></font><br/></a> Fact check: Obama and former radical<br/><br/>6 hours ago<br/><br/>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) â Democratic Sen. Barack Obama is defending his relationship with William Ayers, a college professor who was once part of the radical Weather Underground and spent years as a fugitive after a 1970 explosion that killed three members.<br/><br/>Obama suggests he barely knows Ayers and shouldn't be held accountable for anything Ayers said or did. But others, including Democratic rival Hillary Rodham Clinton, say the relationship gives Republicans an issue to exploit against Obama.<br/><br/>THE SPIN:<br/><br/>Obama was asked about Ayers as part of a discussion of his patriotism in a presidential debate Wednesday night in Philadelphia.<br/><br/>Obama responded that Ayers, now a professor at the University of Illinois, is "a guy who lives in my neighborhood" but hasn't endorsed him and doesn't regularly exchange ideas with him.<br/><br/>"And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values, doesn't make much sense," Obama said.<br/><br/>Clinton seized on Ayers as "an issue that certainly the Republicans will be raising." She pointed out that Obama and Ayers served on a charity board together and brought the 9-11 terrorist attacks into the mix by noting that an interview in which Ayers denied any regret for the radical group's bomb-making happened to appear on the day of the attacks.<br/><br/>THE FACTS:<br/><br/>Ayers was part of the Weather Underground when a bomb the group was making exploded at a New York townhouse. Three people were killed. He fled and spent years as a fugitive. He met and married fellow fugitive Bernadine Dohrn during that period.<br/><br/>The two surrendered in 1980 and were never prosecuted. They now teach at Chicago universities.<br/><br/>Ayers and Obama both served on the board of directors of the Woods Fund, a Chicago-based charity that focuses on developing community groups to assist the poor. A variety of business executives, journalists and academics serve on the board.<br/><br/>When Obama was organizing his first race for the state legislature, the incumbent lawmaker he hoped to replace introduced him to her supporters and urged them to back Obama. One introductory event took place at the home of Ayers and Dohrn, according to published reports.<br/><br/>Ayers contributed $200 to Obama's legislative campaign in 2001, but there is no other sign that he has actively aided Obama's political career.<br/><br/>During Wednesday's debate, Obama argued that if the candidates are to be held responsible for distant connections to the Weather Underground, then Clinton would fail, too. He pointed out that her husband, just before leaving the White House, commuted the sentences of two members of the group who had been convicted of violent crimes. </div><div style="text-align:right">

I have saved a week of vaction this year.  So that i may still do the Week of Awesome AND plan a freaking awesome 3 week vacation of craziness.  I have decided, for sheer cost and awesome ratio.  That I will be planning a trip to out West.  The skeleton of a plan is to fly into Los Vegas (probably because Airfaire is the cheapest there) See Penn and Teller's Show, then rent a car of some sort and travel through all the states, checking out all the cool things that litter the country out there for 3 weeks.  I know I have friends (Tracy, Sean, Adam, Kat) living in Arizona and my sister should be moved into California I believe by then.  Currently, the plan just involves me (but it doesn't nessarily have to involve just me)  If you want to fly out meet up or whatever I can build a plan around that as well.  The idea, it to take a 3 week break, do some camping, sightseeing, Nightlife, reading, DS playing but get away from the computer, bills and normal life for a bit.  I'm planning to do this in Late May.  In hopes to be back in time for my friend's Kate and Adam's wedding.  <br/><br/>So... The questions, Is May a good time to explore the west, in a outdoory sort of way?<br/><br/>Who out west should I stop in and visit?<br/><br/>What places/states should I definitely see?<br/><br/>Anyone want to come out with me for part or all of the adventure? </div><div style="text-align:right">

I realized again (I do this a lot) that there are so many stories out there.  Billions and Billions of people living their lives and everyone of them has a story.  Maybe even two or three!  But we cut ourselves off from people not near us.  We don't learn from their stories.  We walk around the city or wherever and choose not to interact with each other.  Now adays we don't even take interest in a stranger that is sitting next to us in fear that they are some crazy person or don't want to be bothered.  When did we stop being friendly to each other, other then being indifferent.    <br/><br/>What would it take to get people talking to each other again.  Will have to think about that. </div><div style="text-align:right">

When someone warns you of something it might just happen! ^_^<br/><br/>So I'm at a party last night and brought over Vodka and redbull.  So when I get there a guy says "Ah Vodka and Red Bull is a dangerous mix after me and my best friend drank it we were beating each other up later"  I laughed and thought that was funny.  I mean of course I'm a pacifist Iâm not going to end up fighting anyone.  Enter one of my oldest and best friends who is also a Aiko Black belt.  Well as soon as you talk about fighting suddenly well. We were.  Haha. Of course not real fighting but a good friendly nonsexual (had to throw that in of course) wrestle.  Unfortunately we decided to do it on gravel and shorts in my case. Well after a few seconds of weaseling out of a few grips I shut him down. "Dude did you see me, I had his legs and totally shut him down!" (to quote Freaks and Geeks)  Anyhow we got up and brushed ourselves off and I realized I skinned my knee and my glasses were not on!  Oh craps!  Glasses and Rocks do not mix especially with lots of drunk people walking around us!  Fortunately they were found relatively quickly and all was fine.  Except that Geoff and I had to keep talking about how we really would have kicked the other personâs butt if we were serious.  Ah guys. ^_^<br/><br/>Anyhow, reminder to myself, When someone tells a group of you the day before not to call them by a nickname they donât like when you are at the party with that person the next day and the subject of nicknames comes up donât suddenly blurt it out!  Sigh.  <br/><br/>Lastly itâs probably the best thing of the night.  The police were called because our loud obnoxious conversation about Comic books was disturbing the neighbors! </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href="http://cremlian.livejournal.com/116993.html"><font color="blue" face="Arial"><i><b>Late to the party ^_^</b></i></font><br/></a> Well the last week or two, I've actually been playing other games other then WoW (Fancy that).  Mostly the game that I've been playing is Half-life 2.  I had picked it up months ago when I initially built my new computer (along with Neverwinter Nights and D&amp;D online) and I had not gotten around to playing it.  As suspected though being that it's a game of the year (a couple years ago) and is the follow up to Half-life.  It's extremely good.  I especially enjoy the fact that in some parts of the game your actually picking up squad members and Npcs that actually help you out in some useful way.  (expect when there is a motherfing sniper) I also enjoy how the game foreshadows elements that you'll be encountering later very well.  For example at the part of the game I currently playing, I can tell I'm going to be fighting Tripod walker things fairly soon, since whenever I move out onto the street from a building I get to see one walking and shooting somewhere that is else.  (thankifully!) The game also is handy as while you are killing both aliens and security forces those two forces do not work together either and will kill each other while you watch in the shadow if you feel like waiting till they work their differences out (I.E. you kill the last man standing). The Gravity Gun is lots of fun and taking down a gunship with a rocket launcher is one of the more statifying experiences in a recent game.   <br/><br/>I'll definitely be picking up The Half-life eposides once I'm done with this and possibly playing through the orginal one (which I've never completed)<br/><br/>Should really try and get my friends back into Fps multiplayer games.  I could use some Action quake or counterstrike again ^_^ </div><div style="text-align:right">

The dentist said otherwise.  The Tech even commented on how tough my teeth are.  Guess I lucked out.  Only problem is I still have a weird numbness in my face.. They thought it might be caused by something going on in my sinus and since my teeth are right up against it that it could cause the whole area to get numb.  Guess if it continues to be a problem I'll go to the doctors to check it out.  Fun Fun. They also suggested that I think about getting a night guard since I seem to grind my teeth at night.  Since I don't have any pain yet from that there is of course no rush.  <br/><br/>Tonight, is Kitchen cleaning time!  What fun!, but most importantly it means my initial cleaning up of my house is complete!  <br/><br/>So if anyone ever wants to come over, just drop by or call me or leave a message!  and if you need to stay the night I got a nice couch bed! <br/><br/><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><b>Current Mood:</b> <i><img align="absmiddle" alt="" height="17" src="http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/classic/tired.gif" vspace="1" width="19"/> tired</i></font></div><div style="text-align:right">

I decided to hold off on starting the kitchen tonight. However I finally finished organizing and cleaning the living room.  The House almost looks as it did when I first moved all my stuff into it.  Which is pretty good.  Just missing some vital furniture that I'll soon be replacing from my parents basement (which is apparently a endless supply of furniture for me to "borrow".  Finally I did things like hang the coat rack on the wall and put up some wall scrolls by nailing them up.  In my bedroom I hung two wall scrolls,  One of Van with large feathery wings holding Hitomi from Visions of Escaflowne, a wall scroll that Luke and I back in the day hunted down off the internet when it was rare and my other favorite wall-scroll of Ed leaving in Cowboy bebop. So awesome ^_^ Downstairs so far I just hung one of Spike, Julia and Vicious.  I have to resist the urge to completely geek out the house..  But we'll see.  <br/><br/>Hopefully by this weekend I'll have acomplished most of the goals to get my house back in order and thus will start to invite people over again to hang out.  Plus the lack of horrorific heat will make my house not the worst place in the world.  <br/><br/>Oh yea, after 3 years of avoiding it I'm finally going to the dentist.  Quite frankly I'm sure my teeth are a wreck since there is some werid numbness above my left teeth and I can't imagine my teeth being in good shape even though they've always been strong before.  We'll see if I come back with all fake ones ^_^ haha.. Wish me luck!. </div><div style="text-align:right">

Kinda funny how if I get up at 6 am or 7 I still get to work the same time.   Haha!<br/><br/>Well as a update of sorts.  I've been doing a lot of heavy work on my house the last two or three weeks since I've been back from the week of Awesome.  I've finally Finished clearing out the backroom that will soon be Bruce's (who might be getting out of the Navy In October!). I've converted the middle room from my primary computer room to a storage/work area for the other tons of stuff I have.  In my own bedroom I've finally started to put up things on the recently bare walls.  Finally getting wall-scrolls up... (only took me nearly a year.  Otherwise I've made some massive improvements in the way I've organized things upstairs which motivation willing should keep things relatively clean.  Even after finishing my room, I moved on to the bathroom where I realized that I lack a lot of basic cleaning supplies.  However I was still able to do a passable job at cleaning the horridly dirty bathroom.  So all that is left now, is the living room, which will be pretty easy and the kitchen (which is still sorta unfinished as I wait for my dad and money to get freed up to put in a new cabinet system).  Regardless though it should not be much longer till the house is ready for visitors again.  <br/><br/>As for Work, I've been insanely busy.  I worked 4 1/2 hours on Sunday and 11 hours yesterday (Monday) if things hold up I'll be working another 9 or 10 hours today.  Unless I start to pass out. <br/><br/>Well Gotta run to work!  So much work to do! So little time! <br/><br/><font face="Arial,Helvetica" size="-1"><b>Current Mood:</b> <i><img align="absmiddle" alt="" height="17" src="http://l-stat.livejournal.com/img/mood/classic/tired.gif" vspace="1" width="19"/> tired</i></font></div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href="http://cremlian.livejournal.com/113943.html"></a> I finally got to see X-men 3 on Sunday night and since I'm probably the biggest X-men underwear pervert here. I figure Iâll put forth my review of the movie.<br/><br/>I was obviously manipulated by the buzz Iâd gleamed from many sources before I saw this film. Since it was 4 weeks after it opened and most of my friends were guaranteed to have seem the movie already. This marked the first time in the three movies and I didnât see it the night it came out. To tell you the truth I was nervous about it. I enjoyed the first two movies greatly and I could feel that this movie was going to be different.<br/><br/>It was and as I predicted further up this thread it was a mindless action movie. The movie was a mess of two plots that should have been narrowed down to one. The characters having to deal with a mutant cure AND dark phoenix were given little time to be explored or grow. Mainly the movie seemed to float more towards the mutant cure and just slightly touched on dark Phoenix. This completely made the Phoenix plot lose all meaning. Especially Killing Scott Summers off in the first few minutes. Apparently Fox keeps forgetting that the X-men is a team book and that the story doesnât always revolve around Wolverine. Ugh.<br/><br/>Where do I start, If I would have written the X-men movie I would have had Phoenix come back as she always had, but not had her evil in the beginning and as the third movie progressed show her slowly losing control of her power but generally doing ok, until in the final moments of the movie where she solves the climax of the movie in a real unethical way. Leaving the team unsure what to do with her and probably with the world viewing her as a criminal which would then lead into the fourth movie where she finally becomes the âdark phoenixâ. The whole time having Scott Summers try and deal with it and whatnot.. The way this movie dealt with Dark Phoenix took all the emotional build up away from the story. She came back evil and didnât slowly side into darkness. SHE KILLED MOST OF THE PEOPLE WHO CARED ABOUT HER IN THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF THE FILM!<br/><br/>The Kitty Pryde/Iceman/Rogue triangle was a total abortion, that you was a completely wasted chance for all the love triangle action. What the hell was with that last scene with Rogue!<br/><br/>Colossus, Why the crap did they even have him in the movie, did he even say two words? He was the least developed character period. Plus if you have Colossus you have him Fight Juggernaut!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr></wbr>!BITCH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<wbr></wbr>!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Angel, Talk about coming out of nowhere, he escapes, shows up at the mansion for literally 5 seconds and then follows the X-men to save his father and then disappear! Great! Thatâs awesomeâ¦ NOT!<br/><br/>Where the Fuck was Nightcrawler!<br/><br/>Well, since I should be getting to work in a few, I talk a bit about what I liked about the film.<br/><br/>I did enjoy Beast, I thought they handled his character in a very cool way, making him a retired X-men and a politician was a very cool. I enjoyed how he interacted with the other X-men in the traditional Beast corny wit.<br/><br/>The fact that Kitty Pryde was a âmainâ character. She was handled fairly well in the movie, Especially in terms of Combat. I remembered sitting there looking at the team as they lined up to fight the last battle thinking to myself âWhat the fuck is Kitty going to doâ and they made her act pretty cool, and definitely gave her something to do in that fight.<br/><br/>Storm, was infinitely less annoying in this film! While I still hated her role in the film and she was again under developed (gees other the Magneto, Xavier and Wolverine who was actually used in this movie), They actually let her cut loose, I enjoyed that fact that she could fly (however why wasnât she doing that before) and that she actually used some of her powers in a more useful way. (finally)<br/><br/>I enjoyed how Magneto handled Mystique and how he was ultimately defeated. And that he appears to not been âfullyâ defeated.<br/><br/>Finally I have one last beef. The major problem this movie had was lack of consistency in what people could do. The past X-men movies severely underpowered the X-men from their comic book counterparts to try and keep it âmoreâ realistic and to keep them from just pushing the win button, the problem with this movie is that the some characters did things way above what youâve seen then do before. I.E. Magneto moves a Bridge but couldnât break out of prison. Why didnât Magneto just use that mutant that could detect the boy to pinpoint him and then just destroy the whole base on his own! Why doesnât Magneto just take the X-men out that have metal powers (I.E. Colossus and Wolverine) I mean come on! Itâs because of lazy script writing, They wanted to go over the top in the scene with the bridge and that broke the rules that they had laid down in the other movies, where his powers were strong but not godlike. Because he did that they had to make Phoenix just disintegrate things to make it interesting. Was it just me or did Wolverines Healing factor get even more powerful in the movie..<br/><br/>Ugh. Anyhow, the movie wasnât a total crapfest, but it came close. Why couldnât Bryan Singer do Superman and X-men! One hopes that the upcoming Wolverine and Magneto movies have nothing to do with the director and writer of this movie. </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href="http://cremlian.livejournal.com/113369.html"><font color="blue" face="Arial"><i><b>D&amp;D online</b></i></font><br/></a> I have to admit.  This is my first MMO and I was really looking forward to playing it.  When I put down the 50 dollars to buy the game and subscribe to it.  I was unsure as to whether it would be actually worth it.  I'd heard mixed reviews initially about it, However as I play the game, it seems people that reviewed it didn't play more then a few hours in the game.  Like most games, D&amp;D online has a controled area for n00b's.  Where you only have a limited access to quests and the quests are generally pretty short and straight forward.  Usually having only one aspect (like traps, puzzles or something) to give you a hint of how fun the rest of the dungeon will be.  However this quickly changes!  in just a week or two of playing I've encountered missions that involve protecting an item from destruction, missions where if you kill too many of the monsters before you get to the item you fail. (stealth missions)  Clever Traps, that isolate members of the party to have to defend themselves against a encounter alone.. (note this is a good reason to have your mage in the back!!!) Plus, you can always find a party of nice people very quickly  (especially if you are a cleric or a rogue).  I've played the game around 8 or 10 times and I've only failed to party with people once and I just replayed some single player missions for fun.  That's not to say I've hard to replay the missions, just it's easier to solo a mission if you know what you have to do.  <br/><br/>I do understand why people don't like it when they first try the game out.  From what I can gather there isn't many places you can go to just have random encounters.  Also many people want a large and fatastical game world, And while the game only takes place in one city, the adventures I believe have you traveling outside the city and of course especially under it.  I have yet to have wondered through the whole city yet.  I guess if you played the game religiously you might max out the game quickly, but I don't think you'd have completed all the quests in that time, plus the game is a radically different experience depending on what class you play.  My experiece playing the game as a wizard was infinitely different from the experiences I've had as a cleric.  Playing over the beginning missions over again, didn't feel like a chore this way.  <br/><br/>Eh.. anyhow I gotta run off to work. No more ranting about D&amp;D online. </div><div style="text-align:right">

He had put in leave a half a year ago for 3 weeks so he could come to the convention and then hang out with his family and friends. However, the Navy has screwed him, cancelling his leave today a full day before he was supposed to board his flight for home. Mainly because some guy whoâs been telling him to kill himself reported him as threatening him (because Bruce didnât like being told that). Well now heâs filed with JAG and they seem to think he has a case. I hope so. Because the freaking Navy screwed a lot of people, his parents and all of us that were going to Katsucon included. <br/><br/>So I'll let you know what the outcome has, hopefully it's a nice slap in the face for whoever screwed Bruce. </div><div style="text-align:right">

<td><div style="text-align:left"><a href="http://cremlian.livejournal.com/111895.html"><font color="blue" face="Arial"><i><b>"We Used to be friends"  - Veronica Mars Theme Song.</b></i></font><br/></a> "A long time ago, we used to be friends<br/>But I haven't thought of you lately at all<br/>If ever again, a greeting I send to you,<br/>Short and sweet to the soul I intend."<br/><br/>It's kinda weird.  To find myself in Hatboro at my house on a snowy night,  I own a house and live with my loving girlfriend Dawn.  I've got a 9 to 5 job that while isn't intellectually satisfying does pay the bills and lets me listen to podcasts of all sorts through out the day.  But I can't seem to place where things have changed.  So many people in my past i don't have the time to talk to, there are people who were are are still my best friends that I hardly ever talk to (or in a few cases don't talk to me at all).  Maybe after a certain point you feel strange that you haven't contacted someone and you start not talking to them because you feel stupid for not contacting them earlier, or maybe your afraid that they've changed in some way or that you've changed.  Maybe you have some sort of unresolved issue with them or a secert you know but don't want to find out what is really going on.  Regardless, once a friend always a friend.  There are friends of mine that I only see once a year, and I've never spent more then a week ever hanging with them, there are friends that I haven't talked to in 5 years who I've lost contact with.  It's scary how fast life moves, It's already nearly 3 years since I've graduated from college.  I've accomplished alot, but I don't want to lose my past.  Hopefully soon, my computer issues will be resolved and I'll have a more comfortable time sitting on the internet and chatting with people.  knelling infront of a coffee table in my bedroom just makes me not want to post anything.  While I have a plethora of computers none of them can handle the level of multitasking I require.  However my house should be networked together in about two weeks when Bruce comes by and we terminate a bunch of Cat-5E cable I've run through the walls.  <br/><br/>On a different but similiar note, Lately I've been trying to get more deeply involved in the community around me, I've been on the Horsham Envoirnmetal advisory board but I don't even live in Horsham anymore and I haven't explored Hatboro's politicial structure as to whether there is even a board here.  However I started two weeks ago to go to a church, a local Unitarian-Unverisalist Fellowship on Sundays.   Haha, I'm sure I shocked a few people when I said Church since most know my belief system is more towards the deist/Agnostic/Secular Humanist/what day of the week it is belief.  Well, it came out of a feeling that outside of college it is really hard to get to know people in the community without finding organizations that forced people to enencounter each other and since I have no kids and I'm not in school, the best way is these things that occur on Sunday, after going twice, I found I was right, they accepted me with open arms and I quickly befriended a guy who runs "Greater Philadelphia Humanists Society" I'm sure in the future this will turn out to be pretty intriguing.  <br/><br/>Next weekend I'll be Heading to Katsucon with a bunch of old friends from around here (Bruce, Jesse, Chuck, Jon, Jeff, Steve) and Rym.  Should be lots of fun now that I've cut my conventioning down to two a year, (my bank account likes me again)  <br/><br/>Of course before that I'll be spending Monday out with Dawn, as we celebrate a early valentine day on Monday with both of us cutting work for the day to go riding around together and Tuesday I'll be taking her to the Blue Sage, a Veggie restaurant that I haven't eaten at yet but I've heard is very yummy. <br/><br/>I hope I haven't sounded two angsty or anything, overall things are great, I just wish time would slow down a bit and give me time to do all the stuff I want, be it entertainment, education, make the monies, spend quality time with the gf and the like. So in the end, if I haven't talked to you lately I'm probably thinking about ya, I wonder where Tony Arnett went? Maybe he's in Medical school. *Shrug* </div><div style="text-align:right">

Dawn and I then sit down to watch some Undeclared (from netflixs) which is another good show brought to you by the creator of Freaks and Geeks and 40 year old virgin.  However after that when Dawn was watching Glimore girls the dvd was starting to mess up so she openned it and checked the DVD only to find it not able to close!  damn it.  The thing is only about a month old.   that's the third DVD player we've  broken since we moved in.  Of course the other two were old, It's one of those times I almost wish I did get a service plan.  Well at least Panasonic seems to have service centers near by. </div><div style="text-align:right">

A 13 eposide series that is out on DVD and was hidiously cancelled on Fox after only airing 4 eps.  This show is very unique and very addicting much the same way Firefly is.  (It happens to have been created by one of the writers on Firefly and the last 4 eps star Julie Staite! (Kaylee from Firefly)  Yet another show that was shown on Friday nights during the death timeslot on Fox.<br/><br/>Regardless, this quriky show is fun for all.  Be it's story of a graduate of college trying to find her place, to her wacky yet loveable family or the werid varity of fake animals that give her advice.   It's pretty awesome! I give the show high marks though if your not interested in getting addicted to another short lived show, then I'd stay clear. </div><div style="text-align:right">
